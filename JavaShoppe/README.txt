Royals JavaShoppe Checkpoint B 3/3/22

When using our program, it will ask the user for five numbers:

The first question asks for the minimum interarrival time between customers.
The second question asks for the maximum interarrival time between customers.
The third question asks for the minimum service time for each customer.
The fourth question asks for the maximum service time for each customer. 
Finally, the fifth question asks for the number of customers for the simulation.

After these numbers are entered, the program begins its simulation.
The program will create the set number of customers giving each one a random interarrival time and a random service time using the boundaries given by the user. 
The program cycles through a virtual clock, placing customers into the shortest of three queues at the customers arrival time.
After the simulation runs, it will show the average wait time, time of registers not in use, customer satisfaction.
